Most of things i do  Its my trauma response, sorry if i bother you w/ that


I may sometimes zone out // check my socials or busy. I'm sorry if i don't see you. Please whisp in any case. 

If i hide behind someone completely, showing like almost nothing of my skin or have "dni/dniu___" it means either im not mentally okay to interact in that moment, im being comforted by someone or just tired/drained.


My closest friends are....

BYI:


If i find you annoying/ start annoying me, i WILL be rude. Like just go away from me. if i said to leave me alone. Just leave me the fuck alone.


I'm fine with you c+h me and stuff but if i'm with my friends, ask them first if you wanna join a cuddle pile. If they say yes, i won't mind .

I WILL hide and block you if i feel umcomfortable.

i won't tolerate any hate towards me or my friends

I WON'T join parties. I'm on a party alredy with my friends .

If i stop talking, im not mad at you. Its just my social battery at zero, takes a bit to recharge so be patient..


I may sometimes sleep with PT online . Its usually at my name but feel free to c+h! i js won't answer you ^^


Im pretty shy and the best i can do is go with you and crown/compliment ur skin!! but feel free to bmf :3


My skin style changes ALOT on PT since i usually test styles, use for somedays and maybe switch to old style or try new ones. Plz don't assume i copied. I got copied once and it sucks.

Please don't send random friend requests to me if we haven't talked. I'll recuse it.
