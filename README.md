BYI:🎁

I'm fine with you c+h me and stuff but if i'm with my beloved or friends, ask them first if you wanna join a cuddle pile. If they say yes, i won't mind!

I WILL hide you if i feel umcomfortable.

Also i won't tolerate any hate towards me or my friends/beloved

I WON'T join parties. I'm on a party alredy with mah friends and beloved.

If i stop talking, im not mad at you. Its just my social battery at zero, takes a bit to recharge so be patient..

Me nd my beloved 💝 /p
